## Overview of Repository

Code for downloading (in the case of Stop and Frisk Data), importing the data, and producing the figures can be found in [BDS-ReadingDatasets-Plots.Rmd](https://github.com/lindsaypoirier/BDS-ReadingDatasets/blob/main/BDS-ReadingDatasets-Plots.Rmd). Toxic Release Inventory files can be found in the datasets folder, and pngs of the plots can be found in the plots folder.  

## Data Sources

Toxic Release Inventory datasets were downloaded from the [EPA's TRI Basic Data Files](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-2019?) for the entire US for the years 1996 to 2010.

NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk data was gathered from [this](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page) webpage - specifically the 2011 CSV Zip Archive.
